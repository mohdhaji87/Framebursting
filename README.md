# Framebursting

Clickjacking defence one technique is frame bursting...
Framebursting breaks <iframe> and gets out of the frame , so it's not possible to frame the website under malicious
website.

Another option is X-frame-options , but few browsers doesn't support X-frame-options ,
so X-frame option with frame bursting is efficient method to be used.
